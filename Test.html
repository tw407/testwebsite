<!-- Can do style tags and wrap stuff in there instead of linking to seperate css file, but jack wouldn't recommned as it gets messy - best have one for HTML, one for CSS -->
<!-- make divs different through class and id values ID VALUES ARE UNIQUE, classes you can have as many as you want - usually name class or id after what's inside it

DIVs are most common type of tags - just generic "stuff" or "part of a page"->
<!-- For CSS default is to display things in line -->
